# UnitTesterApp

An Android app whose primary purpose is exercising the mighty powers of JUnit, a Java Unit Testing tool. Feel free to copy it and play with it. It is handy for seeing how Unit Testing works.

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To make sure my program was functional and secure, I wrote plenty of tests with a high degree of coverage. Coverage is a measure of how much of the source code is run when executing your tests. It would also be helpful to do a little manual testing by filling out the main() function and using some of the classes to make sure they have the output I'd expect.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I doubt I'll have any users for this program, so there are no user needs. If there was, I would have created a design document that states the various types of users and what they might want to get out of the program. There would then be some specifications of how I intend to deliver the functionality necessary to fulfill those wants and needs.

How do I approach designing software?
I approach software by writing down the basic requirements of a program on a sheet of paper. Then I write some really sloppy pseudocode that sounds like it should fulfill those requirements. Then I try to implement that into real code, only to find that I overlooked this, that , and the other thing. Then, I do some internet research and come up with a new plan, which I put into action. Then I usually manually test my program to make sure it does as I intended it to do.
